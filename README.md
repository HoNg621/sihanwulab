## Research

One of the most common genetic alterations causing cancer is oncogene amplification. Instead of 2 copies, a cancer cell might have 10, 20, 30, or even more copies of an oncogene, promoting unrestrained proliferation. The development of high-throughput sequencing and the human genome map have been critical tools to understand the genetic changes that occur in cancer cells. However, many amplified oncogenes are not physically located where the genomic maps indicate. Instead, they are frequently amplified on **extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)** particles.

ecDNA was first described in cancer in 1965, but it was thought to only occur in 1.4% of cancers. Recent studies, including our research into the ecDNA landscape of clinical tumor samples, have revealed a surprisingly high prevalence of ecDNA in some human cancers, especially in aggressive cancers like those of the brain, lung, and breast. Accumulating evidence suggests that ecDNA is driving malignant behaviors in cancer cells, such as drug resistance.


Given the prevalence of ecDNA in cancer, we sought to interrogate the most fundamental question: what is the structure of ecDNA and its impact on gene regulation? By integrating a series of sequencing, imaging, and computational approaches, we have proven that ecDNA is circular with higher transcriptional activity due to its de-compacted chromatin and rewired cis-chromatin interactions, providing new insight into how circular ecDNA structure impacts oncogene function, bridging ecDNA biology with modern cancer genetics and epigenetics.


**The long-term goal of our lab is to understand the molecular basis supporting ecDNA functions in cancer.** Let’s begin with revisiting one of the most fundamental knowledge in biology, the Central Dogma, which depicts the flow of genetic information, and place ecDNA into the picture. Then we can begin to ask: How does ecDNA replicate? How does ecDNA transcribe? How is the epigenetic landscape of ecDNA altered to enable higher transcriptional activity? By understanding these mechanisms, we will be able to develop specific therapeutic strategies to eliminate ecDNA and target oncogenes that are otherwise undruggable, such as *MYC*.

I am interested in and have an extensive background in cancer genetics and genomics. After graduating from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) majored in Biotechnology, I obtained my Ph.D. training at SYSU,  where I studied genetic alterations in brain tumor development. I then initiated my postdoctoral research at the University of California, San Diego, under Dr. Paul Mischel's mentorship, and studied the structure and function of ecDNA in cancer, revealing its circular shape and the functional impact of its unique physical conformation. I am currently enthusiastic about studying the molecular basis of ecDNA and leveraging this knowledge to develop effective approaches to eliminate ecDNA in cancer as novel oncogene targeting strategies. Besides science, I love music, art, and tech gadgets.

## Multiple postdoc positions opening!
The Sihan Wu lab, based in Children's Medical Center Research Institute (CRI) at UT Southwestern, is scheduled to open in July 2021, and has multiple postdoctoral positions opening now. We study the molecular basis of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in human cancer, including its replication, transcription, and repair, and try to develop effective approaches to tackle these mechanisms to eliminate ecDNA in cancer as therapeutic strategies. Applicants who are intellectually curious and interested in science that bridges cancer genetics, genomics, epigenetics, metabolism, and signal transduction, are encouraged to apply.


Postdoctoral scientist in the lab will conduct cutting-edge research in a protected, interactive, highly collaborative, and well-funded environment, with access to shared facilities including sequencing, bioinformatics, imaging, metabolomics, flow cytometry, molecular pathology, mouse genome engineering, and beyond. Visit our department website through: [https://cri.utsw.edu/](https://cri.utsw.edu/)


Qualifications for these positions include Ph.D. or M.D. degree(s) (or anticipate receiving their degree in the near future) with less than 2 years of postdoctoral experience. Candidates with relevant training involving DNA and chromatin biology, genetics, genomics, epigenetics, signal transduction, cancer metabolism, and bioinformatics, especially with both wet-lab and dry-lab experience, are particularly encouraged to apply. 


Interested applicants should submit the following documents **assembled into one PDF file** to ``seanwu@outlook.com`` (entitled with ***"Postdoc_Application_Your_Name"*** for auto-archiving)


1. A Cover Letter describing your interest in this position.
2. A CV listing your education, training background, publications, and skill set.
3. A 2-page Research Statement summarizing your current research achievement and future research interest.
